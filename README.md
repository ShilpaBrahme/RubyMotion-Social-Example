# RubyMotion Social Example

This is an example of using the iOS 6 Social.framework with RubyMotion to compose a new Twitter, Facebook or Sina Weibo post.

There's also a demonstration of how to programatically post a message via Twitter using the Accounts and Twitter framework. It uses the current Twitter API (v1.1).

The code partly adapted from Apple's [Tweeting sample code](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Tweeting/Introduction/Intro.html).

I was surprised to discover that iOS6 doesn't prompt for authorisation before programatically sending a message (at least in the simulator).
