# RubyMotion Social Example

This is an example of using the iOS 6 Social.framework with RubyMotion. It uses the current Twitter API (v1.1).

It illustrates how to show the message composer, and also how to send a message automatically.

I was surprised to discover that iOS6 doesn't prompt for authorisation before progrmatically sending a message.
